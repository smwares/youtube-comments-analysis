Quality of your brethren can be found by going through the comments how racist & religious hipsters they're.  They spam for different purposes altogether. \\n\\nHis first comment started with rape contexts saying how Afghanistan is better & tried to put a bogus statistical references to boast his Islamic pride. So my responses have been in that regard only.\\n\\nYou guys are always so eager to prove it to everyone by twisting & manipulating statements.\\n\\nWe don't want you here either. Settle in Afghanistan. Cause you support whatever they do Lol Take your 30 million illegal Bangladeshi brothers too. Y'all do nothing other than coming in boats containers & jumping fences filling up jails. Talking about Bilkis Bano since last 20 years after decimating every society with crime, infestation. Weren't you guys parading Israeli women naked like you've achieved trophyor some sorts? There are litera G rape incidents all across Sweden, France, all over the West by your brethren but everything in India make you to wake up your conscience. \\n\\nI never supported such incidents.  My conscience is equal for each one but when you start to throw these vague comparison just to put others down, don't cry afterwards. \\n\\nDon't show your true character & keep cheering each other & leave my feed.    2\n",

My comments were in totally different contexts. Seems no Comprehension skill. Abdul is always busy filling the loose ends it seems. Google NCRB data on Muslim crime share. It's easily available by just a click. Just like your 18 minute logic. In India a total 47000 cases are recorded every year compared to 96000 of USA, 87000 in UK & they don't have a 1.4bn mass.

Then brought some minute by minute data but lost your mind over a statistical response. It needs a kindergarten education to understand the basics of proportion. Explaining the basics of math isn't supportig any crime. You condemn but don't say random things just to put a scoreThen you brought Bilkis. \\n\\nNothing what I've said is patronising or uncontextual by any means. Go by the obnoxious & racist comments in these videos. Religion drives them. Only Abduls involve themselves in such behaviour. You don't care at all. Y'all are like this only. Talk about religion, hate after mastering all of it. I will be judged irrespective of I say nonetheless. Abduls will always stay in their natural habitat.\\n\\nTake your 30 million illegal Bangladeshi brothers from here too. Most do nothing other than filling jails. They just invade everywhere in containers & boats infesting & result in high crime.  These grape incidents are a daily thing in the West rn.

It needs skill to compare a non industrialised country like Indonesia with India. Indonesia is even smaller than my district. There are bigger hilly areas in India than the whole of Indonesia itself & are cleaner & hygienic. India is going through rapid industrialization & unorganised growth. Pollution is imminent. China went through the same phase 2 decades ago. Compare PPP per capita. You will understand where Indonesia stands. Indonesia isn't even something important to be discussed about. It isn't even in the same league to be compared with India.\\nTalking about sexual assault? Remember that you're talking about a 1.4bn populated country. Do a per capita based analysis once.
